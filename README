About
    xsnos is a tictactoe game designed with children age 5-9 in mind.
Players are allowed to act out of turn, but our given visual queues 
about whose turn it is. This play style is much more free form than
most computer tictactoe variants. It is inspired by physical board
games and the richness of interaction kids get from that.

Logging
    Games of tictactoe can optionally be logged. At the end of each
game the move history for that game is sent to stdout. If you would
like this in a file redirect the output to a logfile. If you want
no output redirect the output to /dev/null. 
    The log is printed in the following format:
{Player}->({x coordinate},{y coordinate}):
    Colons delimit each move newlines delimit each game. Undoes 
are not logged, and only the set of moves that lead to the end game
state will be printed. 

Instructions for how to compile and use Xs-n-Os (a.k.a. xsnos)

Requirements
    * GCC and C++ tools
    * mercurial
    * libqtgui4, libqtcore4, pthread-stubs
    (the "devel" packages of libqtgui4, libqtcore4, qmake, and 
        pthread-stubs must be installed prior to compiling)

To get the source code, use the following command:
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ubiquill/xsnos/

To compile the package:
    cd xsnos
    qmake-qt4
    make

You should now be able to run the program:
    ./tictactoe

In the Linux Lab at Portland State University:
    make && ./tictactoe

Style Guide
    xsnos follows the Wildfire style guide, which can be located at
    http://www.chris-lott.org/resources/cstyle/Wildfire-C++Style.html,
    with the following exceptions.

    Section 5.2: Class Methods may also be mixed case (camelCase) in order
                stay consistent with Qt class methods.
